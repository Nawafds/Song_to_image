Project Ideas :
Song to image :
First thing, the user will log into their music app account ( it will be specified later ) then they have to choose a song which they want to convert to an image.
An IA will analyze the song’s lyrics and using an image generator it will produce a photo that represents the song’s lyrics.

A wardrobe generator:
The user will input their skin tone, height, weight, occasion, season, vibe, etc and an IA will generate an outfit for them.
It will check the availability of clothing in famous brands (e.g. Zara, H&M,..) and it will output a full outfit with the links to where to get them at.
