Question) A document explaining why you chose the technology stack that you are demonstrating; 
I’d like the team to consider a minimum of two technology stacks (Node, Django, etc). 
Describe the process and reasoning the team used to select the stack, and explain why 
you chose it over the other. The doc should be added to your ‘docs’ folder on github.

Answer)
In our prototype, we used Flask as a backend framework and Python as a programming language.
In summary, our project searches for the lyrics of the specified song and then generates an image 
that represents that song; hence, we have to ensure that our application is not heavy and is able to 
find and generate results as fast as possible. Therefore, as a backend framework, we thought that Flask
would be most suitable because it provides a built-in environment with a quick debugging process, which 
will allow us to find common ground between our skills and knowledge and provide an easy-fix approach in 
case of any future complications. Along with the fact that is it light weighted, which will provide our 
application quick assistance since the API generating the resulted image would have its own heavy weight, 
so we thought we could make up for its weight by using Flask that supports the API in contrast to Django is
used mainly for more complex projects. The other thing we used is Python as the primary programming language 
in the backend. The reason behind using it is also to cover the knowledge and experience gap we have in our 
group since we all know how to use python, and because it is Flask’s supported programming language. Also, 
in our prototype, we used the Requests library that is being called by our python code to send HTTP requests 
that return all the data needed to be displayed to the user.
