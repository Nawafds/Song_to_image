Sign up story

If the user does not have an account in Lyrify - our project - nor Google, a Sign up option will be available
that allows the user to enter their username, password, and email address. Once these spaces are filled,
the user will see a success message pop out and can go to the login tab, re-enter their information,
and successfully access the program.
