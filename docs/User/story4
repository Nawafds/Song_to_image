(user options) save, discard, download, and share story 

After an image is found (mechanism in Search story), every user will have four buttons to choose from. The first option gives 
the user the capability of saving an image to his/her library(check library access for details). The second capability is just 
discarding the image and returning back to the search page so you can be able to search for another song. You can also download
the found image to your local computer using the download button. For the final compatibility, you can share an image to various
social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, Snapchat, and Imessage.
