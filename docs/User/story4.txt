Profile story:

Once gained access to the program, the bar on top of the page will display a “Profile” button.
When clicked, this button will direct the user to a new page displaying the user’s email address and username.
If the user chooses to sign in with their Google account, the email address and username will be taken from their
Google profile; otherwise, the information the user gave when they signed up the first time will appear instead.
