Search story 

When the user gains access to their music app account they have the choice to search a song from their playlist or they can 
search a song that is not saved to their playlist. When the song is found the program will take the lyrics and send them to 
the AI to produce a picture. If the lyrics are not found then the program will send an error message notifying the user that 
the lyrics are not found. If the song is not found an error message will show notifying the user that the song is not found.
