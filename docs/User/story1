Sign in story

When the user first accesses the website, there will be a login screen. This will include a space titled 
“Username or email address” and a space titled “Password” at the top of the screen in which the user can 
input their login information. If the user has forgotten their username/email, password, or both, there 
will be a “forgot username/password” button that will take the user to a different screen. This screen will
allow the user to enter either their email or username and will send an email to the user that allows them to 
reset their username and/or password. If the user does not already have an account, there will be a button to
sign up towards the bottom of the screen that is explained in the sign up story later in this document.
