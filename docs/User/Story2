Library access story:

Once logged in (as mentioned in the sign-in/ signup stories), in the right corner a user picture will appear 
(mentioned in the user options story below). Once clicked on the user picture many options will appear, one of 
them is “View Library” option. Clicking on this button will direct the user to a different page that contains all
the generated pictures the user decided to save. The pictures will appear as icons by default but they can be organized 
also as lists or sorted by name or date. Each icon in the library is clickable, and once clicked, the chosen picture will 
expand. Beside the picture, many options will appear: download, delete, and share. The “share” option will show the user many 
options, such as share in Twitter, SnapChat, Whatsapp, and other popular applications according to the user’s device’s settings.
