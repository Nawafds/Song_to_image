Search story 

After gaining access to the program, there will be a search bar titled “Search for a Song” and a search button on the main page.
By typing the song's name, the user will be directed to another page that shows the song's name, lyrics, and AI-generated picture.
The generated picture will automatically be saved in the user’s library - as mentioned in the library story. If the user puts a
name of a song that does not exist or the lyrics are not available, a message will appear and notify the user that the lyrics are
not available, or an API error will occur. Another case is when the user inputs a song with explicit and inappropriate lyrics;
an error message will appear indicating that the song violates the guidelines and will not generate an image. Sometimes,
putting the name of the artist beside the name of the song in the search bar will help locate the exact song.
