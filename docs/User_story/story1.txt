Sign in story

When the user first accesses the website, there will be two buttons in the middle of the page: Login and Sign Up. 
The two buttons are displayed together like small tabs. When the user clicks on the Login button, a username and a password space
will be waiting for the user to type their information, along with a “login” button that will allow the user to access the program
if their information is correct. Otherwise, an error message will appear, and the user will not be allowed to access the program.
Also another way the user can choose to log in to the program is by their Google account. Below the username and password blank spaces,
there will be a “sign in with Google” button, which will take the user to another page to log in with their Google account.
The user will be transferred to the program’s main page when successfully logged in with their Google account.
